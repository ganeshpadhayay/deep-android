//What if there are no dependencies between invocations of doSomethingUsefulOne and doSomethingUsefulTwo and we want to get the answer faster,
// by doing both concurrently? use Async

/*
Conceptually, async is just like launch. It starts a separate coroutine which is a light-weight thread that works concurrently with all the
 other coroutines. The difference is that launch returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value, while async returns a Deferred â€” a
 light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide a result later. You can use .await() on a deferred value to get its
 eventual result, but Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed.

/**
This is twice as fast, because the two coroutines execute concurrently. Note that concurrency with coroutines is always explicit.
